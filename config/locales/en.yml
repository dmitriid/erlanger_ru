      Erlang is a programming language used to build massively
      scalable soft real-time systems with requirements on high
      availability. Some of its uses are in telecoms, banking,
      e-commerce, computer telephony and instant messaging.
      Erlang's runtime system has built-in support for concurrency,
      distribution and fault tolerance. Erlang is open-source and
      free.
